# 8-BIT-MULTIPLIER-
An multiplier is a digital circuit or component that is specifically designed to perform multiplication operations on two binary numbers. It takes two binary numbers as input and produces output. There are so many ways to perform multiplication between two numbers.  Multiplication of two 4-bit numbers requires a 4-bit multiplicand register, a 4-bit multiplier register, a 4-bit full adder, and an 8-bit register for the product. The product register serves as an accumulator to accumulate the sum of the partial products.
4 bits from the accumulator (ACC) and 4 bits from the multiplicand register are connected to the adder inputs; the 4 sum bits and the carry output from the adder are connected back to the accumulator. When an add signal (Ad) occurs, the adder outputs are transferred to the accumulator by the next clock pulse, thus causing the multiplicand to be added to the accumulator. An extra bit at the left end of the product register temporarily stores any carry that is generated when the multiplicand is added to the accumulator. When a shift signal (Sh) occurs, all 9 bits of ACC are shifted right by the next clock pulse.
